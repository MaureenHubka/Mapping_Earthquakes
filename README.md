## Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13 Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. Earthquake data in relation to tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth are shown, and earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 can be shown on the map seperately. In addition a third dark map is available. 

## Deliverables Met:
- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
